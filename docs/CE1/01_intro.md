# Introduction to CE1  

Welcome to the CE1 language tutorial. This document provides a brief introduction to the CE1 programming language and walks you through the basics so you can start experimenting with simple programs.  

## What is CE1?  

CE1 is a hypothetical educational language designed to teach core programming concepts in a simple and approachable way. It features straightforward syntax and semantics, making it ideal for beginners.  

## Hello, world  

A canonical first program prints a friendly greeting. In CE1, you might write:  

```ce1  
print("Hello, world!")  
```  

This program uses the built‑in `print` function to display text on the console.  

## Variables and Expressions  

You can define variables using simple assignment. For example:  

```ce1  
x = 42  
y = x + 8  
print(y)  
```  

This code sets `x` to 42, then defines `y` as `x` plus 8, and prints the result (50).  

## Next Steps  

To learn more about CE1, explore the rest of this documentation, which covers control structures, functions, and advanced features. As you read, try running the code examples with the interpreter included in this repository.
