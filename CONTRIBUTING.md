# Contributing to CE1-Framework

We welcome contributions to improve the CE1-Framework documentation, examples, and tooling. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## Getting Started
- Fork the repository and create a branch for your feature or fix.  
- Write clear, concise commit messages that describe your changes.  
- Follow conventional code style for the language you are working in (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).  

## Reporting Issues
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.  
- When filing a new issue, provide a descriptive title and a detailed description. Include steps to reproduce and expected behaviour.  
- Label your issue appropriately (e.g., bug, enhancement, documentation).  

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Keep pull requests focused on a single feature or fix.  
- Reference any related issues in the description using the `#` syntax.  
- Include tests and documentation updates where relevant.  
- Ensure that all CI checks pass before requesting a review.  
- Be responsive to reviewer comments and make updates as needed.  

## Building Documentation
- All documentation lives in the `docs/` directory. Use Markdown for new tutorials and guides.  
- Follow the existing directory structure when adding new language versions or topics.  
- To preview documentation, you can use GitHub Pages (see README for details).
